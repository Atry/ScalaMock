# FAQ

## 1. Thread-safety

* Is ScalaMock thread-safe? Can mocks be used in multi-threaded environment?

  Yes. ScalaMock is thread-safe and mocks can be used in multi-threaded environment. This means that:
  * ScalaMock will work with tests that are run in parallel 
    * Specs2 runs tests in parallel by default and
    * ScalaTest does so with `ParallelTestExecution`
  * You can call mocks from other threads within tests
    * but any such calls must be complete before the test completes - it's an error to call a mock afterwards. 
  * You can use mocks within `Futures`

## 2. Limitations of ScalaMock

* Can I mock `final` / `private` methods or `final class`es?

  At the moment this is not supported, as mocks generated with macros are implemented as
subclasses of the type to mock. So private and final methods cannot be overriden. 
You may want to try using an adapter or facade in your code to make it testable.

* Can I mock `val` / `lazy val`?

  No, the Scala compiler will not allow overiding a `val` with a `def`, so at with ScalaMock 3 this is not possible.
An option we are looking at for the future is `scala-meta`, but this is not yet available for all build targets of ScalaMock.

* Can I mock `object`s?

  No, macros cannot generate a subclass of a singleton `object`, sorry.


* Can I mock Java APIs with raw types?

  Yes - but you will need a bit of boilerplate. Here is an example:

  ```Java
  import java.util.Map;

  public interface Foo {
      public void route2(Map<String, Integer> map);
      public void route(Map map);
  }
  ```

  Test:

  ```Scala
  "raw types" should "work" in {
    trait FooB extends Foo {
      override def route(map: util.Map[_, _])
    }
    val m = mock[FooB]
  }
  ```
